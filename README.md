# Optimal-Market-Making

This project presents an optimal high-frequency market making strategy using the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation.    
The project includes implementations for the following three scenarios:

1. Constant market parameter
2. Stochastic volatility model
3. Implied alpha and stochastic limit order book (LOB) model  

The full source code is written in C++ and is not open source due to its application for real market making purposes.
